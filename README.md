    <h1>üìä Sales Analytics Dashboard</h1>

   <div class="section">
        <h2>üìÑ Description</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on analyzing sales performance data for a fictional superstore to uncover actionable insights. By leveraging data cleaning, visualization, and modeling techniques, the project provides a detailed examination of the store's operations, products, and customers. The insights aim to help decision-makers optimize product portfolios, improve regional sales strategies, and enhance customer retention.</p>
        <p>The analysis was conducted using tools such as Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. The final deliverables include three dynamic dashboards that summarize key findings.</p>
